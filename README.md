### About me :thinking:	

:man_technologist:	I'm Edward, an experienced pentester that loves Android & IOS pentesting, currently working at my blog https://sketler.gitbook.io. I'm not Really active at github right now, but soon will be making progress here too.

:dart:	Got some vulnerabilities that brought me some CVEs and wrote some exploits here and there.

:nerd_face:	I Love being constantly challenged with hard problems, such as killing some Dark souls bosses.
